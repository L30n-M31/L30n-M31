## Hobbies
When I'm not working, you'll find me:

### :video_game: **Playing video games**
> Iâ€™ve been fond of video games ever since I was a kid, exposed to them by my cousins who had a 3DS and PS2 back in the day. My favorite genre, which will never change, is the horror genre. I am a huge fan of the *Resident Evil* franchise.  
> Let's be friends on Steam! We might hit up some multiplayer games :smile:  
> [View My Steam Profile](https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561199092140498/)

### :guitar: **Strumming on my guitar**
> I wouldnâ€™t say Iâ€™m a great guitarist, but Iâ€™m working on it :triumph:. Besides the guitar, I can play quite a few instrumentsâ€”drums, piano, and alto sax. But out of all of them, the electric guitar is my favorite.

### :headphones: **Listening to music**
> Since I love playing instruments, it's no surprise that I listen to music for hours every day. Iâ€™m always interested in hearing new songs from different genres. Iâ€™m a huge fan of rock, and if I had to suggest a band, it would definitely be [Dead Poet Society](https://open.spotify.com/artist/31M8EXHYtEqOqVb1X7JRVe?si=7QKxJBLDTJqGZvWTolABQg) from the US, [Nothing But Thieves](https://open.spotify.com/artist/1kDGbuxWknIKx4FlgWxiSp?si=OVVIc2R5QcqMbnaoPrBizg) from the UK, and [THE ORAL CIGARETTES](https://open.spotify.com/artist/4rqJz9fE9prZvQd8WsQv6q?si=CPsghWZOTJmF_eCtp4Tf3w) from Japan.

### :movie_camera: **Watching a film or series**
> I mostly watch anime or Korean series :laughing:. For anime, my favorite genres are Slice of Life and RomCom, like *From Me to You*. As for movies, *John Wick* is my all-time favoriteâ€”never gets old!
